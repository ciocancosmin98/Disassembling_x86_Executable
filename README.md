# Disassembling_x86_Executable
  The goal of this homework was to identify the purpose and flaws of an executable file written for x86 Intel ISA. After doing that we had to optimize the program in two different ways: - Memory optimization: The executable file had to be as small as possible - Speed optimization: The executable file had to fulfill its functions in as little time as possible( by removing useless operations and improving the time complexity of the functions used )
